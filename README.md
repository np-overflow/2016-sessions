# Overflow 2016 Hangout Sessions

**Purpose**

In each session, we go through quite a fair amount of content and we don't want any of our members to forget what we've covered and not have a way to re-visit the sessions.

This repository will serve as a quick way for you to view each sessions' notes, coupled with a few reference links that we find will be useful.
